This report looks at students at two different schools, and checks what affects their alcholol consumption, and checks how alcohol consumption and school grades could be correlated. \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it possible for us to create a machine learning algorithm that will tell us if a student is passing or failing thier class based on thier family stauts, free time, and alcohol consumption?\n",
    "\n",
    "You would not be suprised if someone were to tell you that everyday drinking will cause a toll on your body which will probablly make an effect on your activities like your school work. \n",
    "\n",
    "In United States, one in four individuals between the ages of 12 and 20 drinks alcohol on a monthly basis, and the ratio changes to five or more drinks every two weeks for a similar proportion of 12th graders. Alcohol consumption among students is generally viewed as a socially important topic and is a reason of concern among many parents and school administrators. In the past some of the researches have been conducted that has shown alcohol consumption negatively affects students as they are not able to balance out their academic work and social life causing potential dropouts and failing classes. On the contrary some researches have shown that drinking alcohol has no significant effect on the student’s performance. So, the objective of this research is to successfully learn if drinking alcohol has any effect on student’s final grades or not and to find out other significant factors that helps in explaining grades of a student.\n",
