## Overview

Drinking has become a norm for many young people. More and more younger people have started to get into drinking and drugs. This report looks at students at two different schools, and checks what affects their alcholol consumption, and checks how alcohol consumption and school grades could be correlated.


## Goals

* Shine light onto the correlation between alcohol asumption and student grades
* See what are the things that could make students get into alcohol


## Motivation & Background

In United States, one in four individuals between the ages of 12 and 20 drinks alcohol on a monthly basis, and the ratio changes to five or more drinks every two weeks for a similar proportion of 12th graders. Alcohol consumption among students is generally viewed as a socially important topic and is a reason of concern among many parents and school administrators. In the past some of the researches have been conducted that has shown alcohol consumption negatively affects students as they are not able to balance out their academic work and social life causing potential dropouts and failing classes. On the contrary some researches have shown that drinking alcohol has no significant effect on the student’s performance. So, the objective of this research is to successfully learn if drinking alcohol has any effect on student’s final grades or not and to find out other significant factors that helps in explaining grades of a student.

## Data

This report will be using the student alcohol consumption from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/prashant111/student-alcohol-consumption).

There were two datasets one for Math classes and the other for Portugese classes. For data cleaning, we wanted to use all the columns in the datasets, but we also want to use both datasets. In order to do that we concatted the two data sets into one big one.
